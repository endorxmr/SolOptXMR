The goal is to create open-source software that aids people mining Monero with excess solar power (as well as other supplementing renewables) in the most profitable way. 
It will accommodate for issues such as:

- Time of day
- Weather fluctuations
- Avoiding depleting batteries below a threshold, that would damage them
- Avoiding overheating of the mining rig
- Leaving enough power for your daily use
